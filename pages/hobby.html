    <p>My favorite hobby is playing video games. I call gaming my hobby because it's my passion
        and gaming can be not only an enjoyable pastime, but a totally healthy and helpful one for different reasons.
        First of all, creativity is an esenntial skill that I have taken from gaming, because it 
        challanged me to think outside the box and solve situations in creative ways.
        Secondly, gaming is actually a major way in which I learn, improve and practice my problem-solving skills. 
        In gaming I get to do things repeatedly, learn from mistakes, try to solve things in different ways
        and apply new techniques to what I've already tried.
        Also, another reason that I like gaming alot is that it helps me with the focus, because when I play
        if I don't focus I can't get ahead. It's a tough skill and helps me with getting better attention in different areas
        of my life.
        Some people says that gaming is bad for your mental health, but I don't think so.If you don't abuse with it gaming is
        a great way to self-improve. Playtime is an integral part of our development as human beings.</p>
